# battle-board
a django battle board for mekwars, could also be used for other games.

This was just a for fun project to try and learn a bit of django, so I'm sure many improvements could be implemented. 

I'm busy now with another project so it'll likely be some time before I revisit this, but it was working except for a bug where if I turn off debug mode the boostrap css seemed to fail to load.

Also I wasnt sure what should be added to the git ignore other than what was provided by default.
